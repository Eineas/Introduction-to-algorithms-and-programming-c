This project is a simple airport flight tracking system developed in the C programming language. It aims to track flights and keep flight status and arrival destination information up to date. The system allows users to list all available flights, search for a specific flight using its flight number, and update the flight status as on time, delayed, or cancelled through a menu-driven console interface. Flight numbers, arrival destinations, and flight statuses are stored in arrays, and the program uses functions, loops, and conditional structures to manage and display flight information. This project was created as part of an introductory algorithms and programming course in order to practice fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, functions, switch-case statements, and user input handling while building a practical and understandable flight tracking application.
